This code is a while loop that continuously prompts the user to input a number representing a month (n1). If the input is greater than 12 or less than 0, it prints "ERRO" as it is not a valid month. If the input is a valid month, it prints the name of the month in Portuguese. The code then checks if the input month has 31 days, 30 days, or 28 days and prints it accordingly. After each iteration, the code asks the user if they want to stop the loop and if they input "sim" (yes in Portuguese), the loop breaks and the code ends.
