This code prompts the user to input a number (n1) and then uses an if-elif statement to check the value of n1 and print a corresponding message. If n1 is greater than or equal to 18, the program will print "muito bom." If n1 is greater than or equal to 14 but less than 18, the program will print "bom." If n1 is greater than or equal to 10 but less than 14, the program will print "suf." If n1 is greater than or equal to 6 but less than 10, the program will print "insuf." If n1 is greater than or equal to 0 but less than 6, the program will print "escrefvar fraco."
