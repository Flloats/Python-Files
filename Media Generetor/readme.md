This code calculates a student's final grade based on four different inputs: the test grade, the grade for homework and notebook, the grade for work sheets, and the grade for activities. Each input is assigned a weight in the calculation, with the test grade being worth 60%, the homework and notebook grade being worth 10%, the work sheet grade being worth 20%, and the activity grade being worth 10%. The final grade is then calculated by multiplying each input by its corresponding weight and adding the results together. The final grade is then printed out for the user to see.
