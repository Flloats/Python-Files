This code is a simple program that calculates the body mass index (IMC) of an athlete. The program starts by printing an introduction that explains the options available to the user: 1 - calculate IMC, 2 - view table, and 3 - exit. The program then enters a loop where the user is prompted to select an option.

If the user selects option 1, the program prompts the user for the athlete's name, age, weight, and height. It then calculates the athlete's IMC and prints the results, along with a classification of the athlete's weight status (e.g. "below normal weight"). If the user enters any negative values for the athlete's age, weight, or height, the program prints an error message.

If the user selects option 2, the program prints a table that shows the different IMC classifications and their corresponding weight status.

If the user selects option 3, the program exits the loop and terminates. If the user enters any other value, the program prints an error message.
