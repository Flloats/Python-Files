This code prompts the user to input a number, assigns it to the variable "n1", and then uses an if/elif statement to check the value of "n1". If the value of "n1" is greater than 7, the program will print "ERRO". If the value is 1, it will print "Domingo" (Sunday in Portuguese), 2 will print "Segunda-Feira" (Monday), 3 will print "Ter√ßa-Feira" (Tuesday), and so on until 7 which will print "Sabado" (Saturday). If the value of "n1" is less than or equal to 0, the program will also print "ERRO". This code is intended to determine the day of the week based on a number input by the user.
