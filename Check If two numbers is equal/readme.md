This code prompts the user to input two numbers, n1 and n2. Then, it uses an if-elif-else statement to compare the two numbers. If n1 is greater than n2, it will print n1. If n1 is equal to n2, it will print "SÃ£o iguas" which means "They are equal" in Portuguese. If n1 is less than n2, it will print n2. Finally, it prompts the user to input another number, nr, but it doesn't do anything with it.
