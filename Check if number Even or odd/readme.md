This code prompts the user to input a number, assigns it to the variable "n1". It then calculates the remainder of "n1" divided by 2 and assigns it to the variable "n2". If the remainder is equal to 0 (meaning the number is divisible by 2), it prints "O número é par" which means "The number is even" in English. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (meaning the number is not divisible by 2), it prints "O número é impar" which means "The number is odd" in English.
