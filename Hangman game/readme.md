This program is a game of hangman, where the user has to guess the word by inputting letters. The program starts by displaying a menu with the options to play or exit the game. If the user chooses to play, a random animal word is selected from a list and the user is given 10 attempts to guess the word. If the letter inputted is in the word, it will be displayed in the correct position. If the letter is not in the word, it will be counted as a wrong attempt. If the user successfully guesses the word, they will be congratulated and given their number of attempts. If the user chooses to exit the game, the program will end.
