This code defines several functions related to determining the eye color of a child based on the eye color and gene information of the parents.
The first function, probabilidade2(), prints a statement about the child having a 75% chance of having brown eyes and a 25% chance of having blue eyes.
The second function, probabilidade1(), prints a statement about the child having a 50% chance of having brown eyes and a 50% chance of having blue eyes.
The third function, castanho(), prints a statement that the child will have brown eyes.
The fourth function, azul(), prints a statement that the child will have blue eyes.
The fifth function, paiazul(), prompts the user for information about the father's eye color and gene information and uses this information to call the azul() or probabilidade1() function.
The sixth function, paicastanho(), prompts the user for information about the father's eye color and gene information and uses this information to call the castanho() function.
The seventh function, mae(), prompts the user for information about the mother's eye color and gene information and uses this information to call the paiazul() or paicastanho() function.
Finally, the last line of code calls the mae() function to start the program.
