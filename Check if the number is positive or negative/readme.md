This code prompts the user to input a number (n1) and then uses an if-elif statement to check the value of n1. If n1 is greater than 0, it will print "O número é positivo" which means "The number is positive" in English. If n1 is less than 0, it will print "O número é negativo" which means "The number is negative" in English. If n1 is equal to 0, it will print "Os números são iguais" which means "The numbers are equal" in English.
